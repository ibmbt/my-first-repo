I'm a Computer Science major at ITU with a passion for coding and technology.<br>
Currently, I'm exploring Arch Linux, learning SQL, and refining my skills in Python, C++, and web development.<br>
Iâ€™m attending this session to enhance my GitHub skills, collaborate more effectively, and better showcase my projects.<br>
In my free time, I enjoy playing football and badminton.<br>
