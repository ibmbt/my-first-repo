During my first GitHub session, I learned how powerful version control can be for managing and collaborating on code.<br>
The ability to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate seamlessly with others in real-time was particularly interesting.<br>
Itâ€™s exciting to see how GitHub not only helps in maintaining clean and organized code but also fosters a collaborative environment where multiple contributors can work together effectively on a project.<br>
